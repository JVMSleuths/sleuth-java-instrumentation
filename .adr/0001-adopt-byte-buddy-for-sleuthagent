ADR 0001: Adopt Byte Buddy for SleuthAgent Instrumentation

Context

We need a Java agent (SleuthAgent) that:

Records every class loaded by the JVM.

Tracks which classes actually execute code.

Initially, this simple goal can be met using the plain Java Instrumentation API. However, we have future aspirations (see below) that require more expressive and maintainable bytecode manipulation.

Decision

We will use Byte Buddy to implement the SleuthAgent.

Consequences

Positive: Accelerated development; easier maintenance; ability to evolve instrumentation rules dynamically; robust error handling.

Negative: Increased binary size; transitive dependency on Byte Buddy.

Future Aspirations Enabled by Byte Buddy

We plan to extend the agent with:

Identify unused methods.
